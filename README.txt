A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/TWoerner94/pen/RVQxLe.

 I used the mediawiki API for this website. It lists 10 search results plus a small snippet (the first one or two sentences of the article).

I used a .getJSON() function to add the results to a <ul> tag instead of AJAX.
